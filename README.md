# High-value-soccer-players
For this project I wanted to do something more along the lines of data analytics. So I decided to make an interactive chart that helps visualize the highest value players plotted based on their value on field compared to their current wage.

To use this program:
1)	I would recommend to use the code on Jupiter notebooks as that is where I originally programmed it.
2)	You must download the soccer players data file and have it saved in the same folder as the Jupiter notebook files are 
3)	Install pandas
4)  Install bokeh
